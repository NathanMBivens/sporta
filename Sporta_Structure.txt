* // SPORTA STRUCTURE // *

NOTE:
I will have each page structured with all detailed React Components.
I will have UI animation throughout each element as well.
The form element will be the primary focus, to show employers how each element can work with each other. It will also have some sort of logic behind it to calculate the quote price.
